## About GreenArrow:

GreenArrow is a Defi protocol with two syndicate DAOs, Fund DAO and Debt DAO. Micro hedge funds and small Venture capitalists join the DAOs in order to invest, lend, and create with startups. Startups have access to staked tokens in form of credit line (credit cards or short term loans) and fund raising.

- Disclosure: The project is still in development stage 

Problems needs to be solved:
Market players: 
- Investors as in micro hedge funds and small VCs
- Startup founders, specifically operating in Blockchain

Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO):

The protocol will host an Off Chain voting system but for the sake of this Competition an On Chain voting system is coded.

Types of DAOs:

| Feature    | On-Chain Governance | Hybrid Governance             |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Gas Costs  | More Expensive      | Cheaper                       |
| Components | Just the blockchain | An oracle or trusted multisig |

Staking:

Someone is said to have a stake in a venture when they contribute some assets in exchange of exercising some level of control, influence, or participation in its activities.

In the cryptocurrency world this is understood as giving users some kind of right or reward for as long as they donâ€™t transfer some tokens in their possession. A staking mechanism usually encourages token holding against token trading, which in turn is expected to drive up the token valuation.

To build this staking mechanism we will need:

- A staking token.
- Data structures to keep track of stakes, stakeholders and rewards.
- Methods to create and remove stakes.
- A rewards system.

That's it for this code!
