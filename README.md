## About GreenArrow:

GreenArrow is a Defi protocol with two syndicate DAOs, Fund DAO and Debt DAO. Micro hedge funds and small Venture capitalists join the DAOs in order to invest, lend, and create with startups. Startups have access to staked tokens in form of credit line (credit cards or short term loans) and fund raising.

- Disclosure: The project is still in development stage 

Problems needs to be solved:
Market players: 
- Investors as in micro hedge funds and small VCs
- Startup founders, specifically operating in Blockchain

What is GreenArrow offering?
- GreenArrow is a Defi protocol to be built over the Ethereum network. GreenArrow is LENDING money to STARTUPS in the form of CREDIT CARDs or LOANs and PROVIDING RETURN for VCs to supply LIQUIDITY to the protocol.

- The protocol is deployed to exclusively serve investors (referred to here as liquidity providers or LPs)— as in micro hedge funds and small Venture Capital firms — and startups (Borrowers). Binary choice is given to LPs to join one of the two specific end-target Decentralized Autonomous organizations (DAOs) or both. The first DAO acts as a Venture Debt, i.e., liquidity pool with more in-depth functionalities. LPs provides liquidity by staking funds using the protocol stablecoin that is pegged to set of Stablecoins - DAI, USDC, or USDT — in a pool contract. Then, from the same pool, startups can borrow with an algorithmically derived interest rates, at specified reserve levels. In addition, part of the funds is allocated to the Crypto Card, where startups can pay for day-to-day activities. The second DAO is an equity financing DAO, replacing the traditional fundraising scheme with a direct contribution by LPs in funding the startups. Startups are matched with members of the DAO to receive requested funds, with equity and terms deployed by smart contracts and agreed upon via an off chain voting mechanism.

Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO):

The protocol will host an Off Chain voting system but for the sake of this Competition an On Chain voting system is coded.

Types of DAOs:

| Feature    | On-Chain Governance | Hybrid Governance             |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Gas Costs  | More Expensive      | Cheaper                       |
| Components | Just the blockchain | An oracle or trusted multisig |

Staking:

Someone is said to have a stake in a venture when they contribute some assets in exchange of exercising some level of control, influence, or participation in its activities.

In the cryptocurrency world this is understood as giving users some kind of right or reward for as long as they don’t transfer some tokens in their possession. A staking mechanism usually encourages token holding against token trading, which in turn is expected to drive up the token valuation.

To build this staking mechanism we will need:

- A staking token.
- Data structures to keep track of stakes, stakeholders and rewards.
- Methods to create and remove stakes.
- A rewards system.

That's it for this code!
